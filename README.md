# Phys51M
This is just a repo of TeX'ed up versions of the Physics51M problem sets for Fall 2019. 
I'm an amateur with LaTeX, so if you can help out in any way, that would be cool.

If there are mistakes--please let us know by making an issue in the issues tab. That being said, you as the user are responsible for making sure that the homework that you do is correct. That means if something is wrong with the TeX file, whether it be a wrong number or a missing problem, it is your responsibility to take care of that issue. Do not blame the person that TeXed up the homeork if there is a problem with your homework. (paragraph shamelessly taken from Omari's git for Phys51 problem sets)
